#This program was written by Duc Nguyen on Jan 8, 2020.
#This program will ask the user for a part number. If the part number exists,
#the corresponding part name will be printed. If the part number does not exist,
#an appropriate message will be given to the user. The program will stop when
#the user enters a part number of â€“1. This program will use the Binary Search
#method
